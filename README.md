 ## NOTE
 ## Challenges
- The requirements needs to use redux, which I'm familiar with but not quite conversant with it. I have some previous knowledge about `REDUX` but stopped using it some times back after reading many blogs that prefer `useState` hook or `useContext`. I can still however leaern it in a day if it used at the organization.
- The endpoint for the `PATCH` operation seems to have an issue but the updates works. It only needs the users to refresh the page to see the changes
